Introduction

This Audio Spectrum Visualizer analyzes audio input through an electret microphone and displays the frequency response in real-time on an LED strip. The project is powered by an Arduino Nano and uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to split audio into different frequencies, lighting LEDs based on the signal intensity.

Features

Real-time frequency spectrum display

Customizable number of frequency bands

Colorful LED effects to match the audio input


Components

Arduino Nano (or any compatible Arduino board)

WS2812B LED strip (30-60 LEDs recommended)

Electret microphone amplifier module (MAX9814 or MAX4466)

Jumper wires

Breadboard

5V Power supply (for LED strip)


Circuit Diagram

Connect the components as follows:

Microphone VCC to 5V on Arduino

Microphone GND to GND on Arduino

Microphone OUT to A0 on Arduino

LED strip Data IN to D6 on Arduino

LED strip VCC to external 5V power supply

LED strip GND to GND on Arduino and external power supply


Ensure to connect the Arduino and LED strip grounds together.

Setup Instructions

Hardware Setup

1. Connect the microphone module to the analog input pin (A0) of the Arduino Nano.


2. Connect the data line of the WS2812B LED strip to digital pin D6 on the Arduino.


3. Power the LED strip with an external 5V supply, sharing a common ground with the Arduino.



Software Setup

1. Install the Adafruit NeoPixel library for LED control and arduinoFFT library for FFT processing:

Open the Arduino IDE.

Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.

Search for Adafruit NeoPixel and arduinoFFT. Install both libraries.




Upload the Code

1. Open the Arduino IDE.


2. Paste the following code into a new sketch.


3. Select the correct board and port, then upload the code.



Code

#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
#include <arduinoFFT.h>

// Constants
#define LED_PIN 6
#define NUM_LEDS 30
#define MIC_PIN A0
#define SAMPLE_SIZE 64

// FFT and LED setup
arduinoFFT FFT = arduinoFFT();
Adafruit_NeoPixel strip = Adafruit_NeoPixel(NUM_LEDS, LED_PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

// Variables
double vReal[SAMPLE_SIZE];
double vImag[SAMPLE_SIZE];

void setup() {
  strip.begin();
  strip.show();
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Read audio signal and populate FFT arrays
  for (int i = 0; i < SAMPLE_SIZE; i++) {
    vReal[i] = analogRead(MIC_PIN);
    vImag[i] = 0;
  }
  
  // Perform FFT
  FFT.Windowing(vReal, SAMPLE_SIZE, FFT_WIN_TYP_HAMMING, FFT_FORWARD);
  FFT.Compute(vReal, vImag, SAMPLE_SIZE, FFT_FORWARD);
  FFT.ComplexToMagnitude(vReal, vImag, SAMPLE_SIZE);

  // Map FFT results to LED strip
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++) {
    int intensity = map(vReal[i], 0, 1024, 0, 255);
    strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(intensity, 0, 255 - intensity));
  }
  
  strip.show();
  delay(30);  // Adjust for smoother animation
}

Code Explanation

1. Data Collection: Audio data is read from the microphone and stored in arrays.


2. FFT Processing: The arduinoFFT library processes the audio data to analyze frequency bands.


3. LED Mapping: The LED color intensity is adjusted according to the strength of each frequency band, creating a visual effect that corresponds to the audio spectrum.

Future Improvements

Add more frequency bands for smoother visual effects.

Experiment with different color gradients or patterns.

Use a more powerful microcontroller, like an ESP32, for smoother FFT processing.
